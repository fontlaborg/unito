The final downloadable font files are stored in ./fonts/ which is equivalent to https://github.com/fontlaborg/unito-font/raw/refs/heads/main/fonts/ for download links

./docs/index.html is https://fontlab.org/unito-font/ (hosted on Github Pages)

Analyze the entire project and inside ./docs/ develop a spectacularly-looking beautiful functional minisite for the Unito font family. Use [opentype.js](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/opentype.js) if needed.
